#Restaurants (YUI)

[YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/) is a JavaScript library developed by Yahoo, as an alternative to jQuery.

This app queries different types of restaurants using [YQL module](http://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/yql/) in a panel. The widgets can be reordered (drag and drop), and the restaurants filtered.

I'm a terrible Front End developer. It's quite hard for me to apply Clean Code principles in Javascript, in the same way I do it in Java (I don't know if it's just me or the nature of the language), so I'm not totally proud of this code.

There are plenty of comments in the code, its only purpose is making me remember what the hell I did next time I read this code, as currently I don't develop using Javascript on a daily basis, and I'll forget everything for sure.
